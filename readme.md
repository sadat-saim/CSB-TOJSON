# CSV to JSON UI

This is an interesting project for me because I have used JS to solve this problem instead of just hard entering 500 entries into an excel file and export a pdf  instead I have used JS and a package called CSVTOJSON to parse CSV file and used express js as a server to pass data from backend to frontend and I have leared about CORS and Asynchronous Javascript.
